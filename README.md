# 🎓 Unified Mentor Internship Project Portfolio 📊🤖

By Anushka Rana

Welcome to my unified internship project repository! This README outlines the four major data-driven projects I worked on during my internships. These projects involve data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and real-world applications across industries like entertainment, social media, HR analytics, and content strategy.

📁 Projects Overview

📺 1. Netflix Data – Cleaning, Analysis & Visualization

Objective:

To clean, explore, and visualize Netflix content data to uncover viewing trends, country-wise content production, and evolving content strategies.

Key Highlights:

Cleaned dataset (nulls, duplicates, data types).

Visualized:

Content growth over time.

Ratings distribution.

Country and genre trends.

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insights.

Insights Uncovered:

The US is the top content producer.

A steady increase in TV Show content over time.

PG-13 and TV-MA are dominant rating categories.

📈 2. Unlocking YouTube Channel Performance Secrets

Objective:

To analyze and predict YouTube channel performance using regression modeling and feature engineering.

Key Highlights:

Engineered metrics: Engagement Rate, Revenue per View.

Built a Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluated with:

MSE: 75.70

R² Score: 0.13

Identified Subscribers and Likes as key factors.

Future Scope:

Add content category, watch time, and sentiment.

Explore advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM).

👩‍💼 3. IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Performance

Objective:

To understand patterns and factors behind employee attrition using classification models.

Key Highlights:

Performed EDA on IBM HR dataset.

Analyzed features like JobRole, WorkLifeBalance, OverTime.

Used Random Forest Classifier for attrition prediction.

Achieved promising accuracy in classifying at-risk employees.

Business Insights:

Overtime and low work-life balance correlate with high attrition.

Some departments showed higher turnover rates.

📸 4. Instagram – Fake, Spammer, or Genuine Account Detection

Objective:

To classify Instagram accounts as fake, spam, or genuine using machine learning techniques.

Key Highlights:

Feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Built Random Forest Classifier with ~93% accuracy.

Key features: profile pic status, number of followers/following, username structure.

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Future Scope:

Include network-based and behavioral features.

Real-time classification via deployment.

Integrate deep learning for profile image/text analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Modeling: Random Forest (Classifier & Regressor), GridSearchCV

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

Deployment Prep: joblib

Platform: Google Colab

📌 How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📈 Results Summary
